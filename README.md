# Universal Key Remapper Mod for Prey (2017)

This is a mod for the game Prey (2017) that allows you to remap keys to your liking. The mod was made using the Chairloader modding framework.

## Features

- Remap any key in the game to any other key on your keyboard or mouse
- Save and load custom key mappings
- Intuitive user interface

## Installation

To install the mod, you will need to have the [Chairloader](https://github.com/thelivingdiamond/Chairloader) modding framework installed. Once you have Chairloader set up, simply download the latest release of the Universal Key Remapper Mod and install it using ChairManager

## Usage

To use the mod, launch the game with the Chairloader framework and enable the Universal Key Remapper Mod. This will bring up the key remapping user interface, where you can set up your custom key mappings.

The user interface is designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible. To remap a key, simply click on the key you want to change, then press the key you want to map it to. You can also map keys to mouse buttons, and save and load custom key mappings.

If you need more advanced functionality you can go into the advanced menu and edit individual game actions on a per action map level. This is recommended for those familiar with Prey's internals only. 

## Compatibility

The Universal Key Remapper Mod should work with any version of Prey (2017) that is compatible with the Chairloader modding framework. However, we cannot guarantee compatibility with other mods that modify the game's input system. It also disables the in game keybind editing system when in use, so please keep that in mind. 

## Support

If you encounter any issues while using the Universal Key Remapper Mod, please submit a bug report on the Github repository page.
